                Welcome to Tan Li En's Photography!
            </h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my website! I'm Tanlien, a 20-year-old photographer who fell in love with the art of
                capturing
                moments during my secondary school years. With over 7 years of experience under my belt, I have honed my
                skills and developed a deep appreciation for the magic of black and white photography.<br> <br>

                For me, black and white photography is a gateway to a world of timeless beauty. Through the
                absence of
                color, I focus on capturing the essence of a sceneâ€”the interplay of light and shadow, the
                intricate
                details,
                and the emotions that unfold. I believe that black and white photography has a unique ability to
                evoke a
                sense of nostalgia, depth, and raw emotion.<br> <br>

                By skillfully utilizing the contrast between black and white, I create images that bring
                out the true
                character and essence of the subject. Through the careful manipulation of shapes,
                textures, and
                atmosphere,
                I aim to evoke a profound visual and emotional experience for viewers. Black and white
                photography
                allows me
                to express not only the physical aspects but also the psychological and emotional
                nuances of the
                subjects I
                capture.<br> <br>
